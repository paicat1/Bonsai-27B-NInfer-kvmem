NInfer supplies a target-scoped CMake build without downloads. Local correctness patch in cpp/json_schema_converter.cc: bounded JSON strings exclude all
U+0000..U+001F control characters, matching the unbounded JSON string rule.
Regression: tests/text/test_structured_output.cpp. The additional-property exclusion trie uses Unicode codepoints and excludes escaped aliases of
declared properties before divergence, preventing duplicate-key overwrites from bypassing a
property schema. This restricts some otherwise valid key spellings.
Other upstream sources are unmodified.

Numeric-range correctness patch: GenerateNumber rejects the empty-range regex sentinel instead of
interpreting it as an empty JSON number. This matters when the six-decimal generation grid contains
no value inside an otherwise nonempty real interval. Covered by the structured-output grammar tests.
